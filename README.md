# kwoc-bugs

This Repository tracks all the filed bugs for KWoC. Mentors and Students are encouraged to use this, in case they find an unexpected behaviour with the webapp.

### Description
We have tried to provide a good User Experience among the users, still there might be some issues/shortcomings with the WebApp.
It would be nice for you to file the **_bugs / issues / feature-request / shortcomings / user experience issues_**, for the same, and
would be practically possible for us to manage the workflow and logistics of the changes.

### Creating an issue
Click [here](https://github.com/kossiitkgp/kwoc-bugs/issues/new/choose) for creating an issue. Use the header field for describing the issue, and some details about it in the comments field.

* Try to describe your problem in an elaborate manner.
* If possible, use **_references / examples / images / screenshot_** of the issue that you are facing. It is true that a picture speaks a thousand words. Use graphics to your advantage.
* Don't tag a specific person while opening an issue, we are continuosly monitoring the issues tab, and a corresponding team member would be taking care for it.
* Please be _reasonable_ with the expectations, we truly understand how a bad User Experience spoils the mood, but some patience from your side would help us in investigating the issues.
* Finally, we would be happy if you could **_try / test_** out all the features and let us know about the issues if any, this would help us in fixing them ASAP, and prevent others from having the same issue.
