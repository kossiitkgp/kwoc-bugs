# kwoc-bugs 🐛

This Repository tracks all the filed bugs 🐛 for KWoC. Mentors🧑‍🏫 and Students👨🏽‍🎓 are encouraged to use this, in case they find an unexpected behaviour with the webapp.

### Description
We have tried to provide a good User Experience among the users, still there might be some issues/shortcomings with the WebApp.
It would be nice for you to file the **_bugs / issues / feature-request / shortcomings / user experience issues_**, for the same, and
would be practically possible for us to manage the workflow and logistics of the changes.



### Creating an issue
Click [here](https://github.com/kossiitkgp/kwoc-bugs/issues/new/choose) for creating an issue. Use the header field for describing the issue, and some details about it in the comments field. Or else you can create issues directly on the specific repositories for frontend and backend: 

- KWoC Frontend - https://github.com/kossiitkgp/KWoC-21-Frontend
- KWoC Backend - https://github.com/kossiitkgp/KWoC-Backend


* Try to describe your problem 🐱‍💻 in an elaborate manner.
* If possible, use **_references / examples / images / screenshot_** of the issue that you are facing. It is true that a picture speaks a thousand words. Use graphics to your advantage 🛹.
* Don't tag a specific person while opening an issue, we are continuosly monitoring the issues tab, and a corresponding team member would be taking care for it.
* Please be _reasonable_ with the expectations, we truly understand how a bad User Experience spoils the mood, but some patience from your side would help us in investigating the issues ✔️.
* Finally, we would be happy 🤗 if you could **_try / test_** out all the features and let us know about the issues if any, this would help us in fixing them ASAP, and prevent others from having the same issue 🥳.
